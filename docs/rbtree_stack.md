## Overview

If we now bring all of the strengths of the past improvements I have discussed, we can make a more space efficient, fast allocator that solves some of the challenges a heap allocator implementation poses for red black trees. One technique that is common when we want to save space in a red black tree is to eliminate the parent field. Instead, we use an array and treat it as a stack to represent the path down to the nodes we need to work with. This eliminates an eight byte pointer from the struct and in a normal red black tree might look something like this. Please note, I am using my array method for this implementation as well to eliminate symmetric cases.

```c
typedef struct heap_node_t {
    header_t header;
    struct heap_node_t *links[2];
}heap_node_t;
```

There is one problem with this approach for a heap allocator however. I could not think of a good way to coalesce nodes with the above struct. The problem arises with duplicates. When we insert duplicates into a red black tree, we know that they will always follow the rules of a binary search tree in relation to their parent, but we do not know where rotation may put them over the lifetime of the heap. This is a problem for a coalescing operation that needs to find the exact address of the node it needs.

When we search the tree by block size, as we normally do, there is no garuntee the first node of the correct size we find will be the one we are coalescing. This would result in a non sequential block of memory and corrupt the heap. So, we will simply take from our previous allocator, and store duplicates in a doubly linked list. Then we are free to use the stack, because we know that all nodes in the tree will be unique. We also have immediate access to coalesce any duplicate safely in constant time from its linked list. Here is the node. Here is the new tree scheme without a parent field. Now, the only way we know we are in the linked list is by setting the `list_start` field to `NULL` rather than `black_null`.

```c
typedef struct heap_node_t {
    // block size, allocation status, left neighbor status, and node color.
    header_t header;
    struct heap_node_t *links[2];
    struct heap_node_t *list_start;
}heap_node_t;
```

This allocator will be slightly slower than the previous allocator with a parent field, but more space efficient. This was also the most challenging of all the allocators for me to implement. It requires a strong handle on a spacial understanding of the changes that occur in a tree during rotations and transplants. We have to manage the array ourselves, accurately updating the nodes in the stack if they move or rotate during fixup operations and keep a good track of our index. It was challenging for me to apply the same structure of CLRS over a stack implmentation. I might recommend looking over the [`libval`](https://adtinfo.org/libavl.html/Red_002dBlack-Trees.html) implementation of a red black tree with a stack if you were to do this from scratch. It is a different approach and I struggled to read the code due to the naming convenients and lack of comments. However, I am sure it would be a good starting point to implement this technique. So, I stuck with the past implementations I had done and reworked them for this technique.

## Unified Stack Analysis

- **`free()`**- Freeing an allocated heap block takes one $\Theta(lgN)$ search to find the place for a new node. In this implementation however, we have a significant best case. If we find a node of the same size that we are inserting, we can insert it into the doubly linked list in $\Theta(1)$ time and we do not need to rotate or recolor the tree. If the node does not exist in the tree, we have the normal $\Theta(lgN)$ fixup operations.
- **`malloc()`**- Searching the tree for the best fitting block requires one $\Theta(lgN)$ search of the tree. Again, however, we can eliminate fixups if the best fit node is a duplicate. Then we have $\Theta(1)$ operations to take the duplicate from a doubly linked list.
- **`coalesce()`**- Both `free()` and `realloc()` coalesce left and right to maximize on reclaimed space. If the coalescing operation finds a duplicate node, it will be freed in $\Theta(1)$ time because I have setup the doubly linked list such that we know we are in the list and not the tree. We also have the node in the tree serving as the head and the sentinel black tree node serving as the tail. This makes coalescing a duplicate a constant time operation most of the time. However, there is one bad case that can slow us down without the parent field. If we coalesce the node that is in the tree and serves as the head of the doubly linked list, we have a problem. To delete that node, we need to find its parent so that we can link up the next node in the list as the tree node correctly. This requires a $\Theta(lgN)$ search of the tree to locate the parent node.
- **`style`**- This was a challenging implementation to complete, but it is able to loosely follow the structure of all other implementations up to this point. The greatest concern for this allocator is the readability of the stack management. To improve the style of this code it would be important to come up with a consistent method for rearranging and managing the stack during fixup operations. There are specific adjustments to the path in the stack that are required for rotations and deciding where and when to adjust the nodes in the array is an important style question.
