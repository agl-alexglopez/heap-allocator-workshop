# Compiled Files

The compilation process places all different versions of the heap allocator compiled in conjuction with the `test_harness.c`, `time_harness.c`, and `my_optional_program.c` here in the `obj/` folder. I am including this readme, even though the `obj/` folder is ignored, so that if you decide to make this project you will not get a fatal error on first compile. This error occurs because git does not track empty folders, like the `obj/` folder.
