 * -------------------------
 * This program prints information regarding the peak size of the free node data structure used by
 * a custom heap allocator implementation. For example, if a heap allocator uses a list to manage
 * free nodes, it will print a visual representation of a list representing the greatest size the
 * free list acheived over the course of heap execution on a dedicated script file. This will also
 * print the tree structure of my red black tree heap allocator at its greatest size over the
 * course of its lifetime.
